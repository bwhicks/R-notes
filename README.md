# Working with R -- an introduction

This repo contains some sample code that we will use in a workshop on the 
basics of R, some of its particular strengths for digital humanities research,
and resources to help you pursue learning R if that makes sense for you.

## Basic Resources

*[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) - CRAN is the network that distributes R
and its compiled binaries. CRAN also supports the infrastructure for loading
R modules.

*[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) - Open source integrated development
environment (IDE) for R. Highly useful and recommended, it also integrates
many of R's other more useful functions (i.e. documentation and code living side
by side).

*[r-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/) - Open blog with many contributed
articles by R users. Exceptionally useful resource to Google.

## Books you might want (and are available electronically with PUL)

*[R for Data Science](https://pulsearch.princeton.edu/catalog/9035462)

O'Reilly/Packt is a standard of the how-to and coding genre. This book is a good overview
of R used in a practical sense.

*[R Cookbook](https://pulsearch.princeton.edu/catalog/7368582)

Another of O'Reilly's offerings that you might find interesting once you have
some handle on the basics of R (or even as you're learning and want to try out
code).

*[Text Analysis with R for Students of Literature](https://pulsearch.princeton.edu/catalog/8559934)

Jockers' text is a stanard and it comes with many useful examples available on
[his website](http://www.matthewjockers.net/text-analysis-with-r-for-students-of-literature/).

## Some other resources

[Princeton R Tutorial](http://data.princeton.edu/R/)

Princeton's own Germán Rodríguez has produced a set of notes that are a comprehensive
initial resource for anyone trying to get familiar with R.
